# Omron

Omron Blood Pressure Monitor measures highly-accurate blood pressure readings to monitor a user’s blood pressure. In conjunction with MD2K software, these blood pressure readings can be taken at home with the push of a button and can be easily tracked over a period of time to improve patient care.

Omron Weight Scale is a digital scale to track a user’s weight. The sensor uses Bluetooth technology and is integrated with MD2K software to monitor weight measurements and maintain records of weights taken at any given intervals over a period of time.
