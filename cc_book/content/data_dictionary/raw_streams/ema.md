# mCerebrum EMAs
These are the processed Ecologic Momentary Assessment (EMA) data in JSON format that comes from mCerebrum.

**Note:** These EMA files are self-describing, meaning they have the EMA questions and answers contain in the JSON data. Therefore, this page will serve as an example to show the format and assist with basic understanding of the data. The specifics regarding the data will vary greatly for each EMA.


**Example stream name structure:**
`org.md2k.<APPLICATION>+<STREAM_NAME>+<ATTACHMENT>`

**Example names:**
- `org.md2k.scheduler+EMA_RANDOM`
- `org.md2k.mindfulnessstrategy+MINDFULNESS_SMOKING+PHONE`
