# Stress

A stress episode indicates an instance of stress using cStress, a model for inferring stress from wearable sensors. cStress was trained using data collected from a rigorous lab study with 21 participants and validated on two independently collected data sets. It has been carefully developed with attention to every step of computational modeling including data collection, screening, cleaning, filtering, feature computation, normalization, and model training.
