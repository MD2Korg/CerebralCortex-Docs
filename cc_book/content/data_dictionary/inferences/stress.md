<!-- A smoking episode indicates an instance of smoking using puffMarker {% cite saleheen2015puffmarker %}, a multi-sensor approach for pinpointing the timing of a lapse in smoking cessation using two wearable sensors:

- AutoSense to track breathing patterns from respiration
- MotionSense to track arm movements from 6-axis inertial sensors worn on wrists
